# Etheritance

Etheritance is a Solidity smart contract designed to automate the inheritance process on the Ethereum blockchain. This contract allows parents to securely manage and distribute funds to their children based on predefined conditions, such as a specific release time. It ensures that inheritance is handled transparently and securely, providing peace of mind for families.

## Introduction

### Purpose of the Document
This document serves as a comprehensive guide for developers and users of the Etheritance smart contract. It provides installation instructions, usage examples, and detailed explanations of the contract's functionality.

### Target Audience
The target audience includes developers with a basic understanding of Solidity and smart contracts, as well as individuals interested in using blockchain technology for inheritance management.

### Overview of the Code
Etheritance is significant as it leverages blockchain technology to automate and secure the inheritance process. The contract ensures that funds are only released to beneficiaries under the specified conditions.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites and Dependencies
- MetaMask (or any other Ethereum wallet)
- Truffle or Hardhat (optional for testing and deployment)

### Step-by-Step Installation Instructions
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jamesiswanto/etheritance.git
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd etheritance

## Getting Started

### Main Features and Functionalities
- Add a beneficiary (child) with predefined conditions.
- Deposit funds to a specific beneficiary's account.
- Check if funds are available for withdrawa based on release conditions.
- Securely withdraw funds to the beneficiary's wallet.

### Important Concepts and Terminology
- **Beneficiary (Kid):** The child who will receive the funds.
- **Release Time:** The timestamp when the beneficiary can access the funds.
- **canWithdraw:** A boolean flag indicating if the beneficiary can withdraw the funds.

## Configuration and Customization

### How to Customize the Code for Specific Use Cases
- Modify the **`releaseTime`** parameter to set different conditions for each beneficiary.
- Adjust the logic in **`availableToWithdraw`** for more complex conditions.

### Best Practices and Recommended Configurations
- Ensure that the **`releaseTime`** is set correctly to avoid premature withdrawals.
- Regularly audit the contract for security vulnerabilities.

## Troubleshooting and FAQs

### Common Issues and Their Solutions
- **Issue:** Unable to withdraw funds
  - **Solution:** Ensure the **`releaseTime`** has passed and **`canWithdraw`** is set to **`true`**.

### Error Messages and Their Meanings
- **"You cannot withdraw yet":** The current time is before the **`releaseTime`**.
- **"You must be the kid to withdraw":** The withdrawal request is not coming from the beneficiary's wallet.

### Frequently Asked Questions
- **Q:** Can I add multiple beneficiaries?
  - **A:** Yes, you can add multiple beneficiaries with different conditions.
 
## Security Considerations

### Potential Security Vulnerabilities and Their Mitigation
- **Reentrancy Attacks:** Use the **`check-effects-interactions`** pattern to avoid reentrancy issues.
- **Unauthorized Access:** Ensure only the contract owner can add beneficiaries.

### Secure Coding Practices
- Alwayus validate input data.
- Use appropriate access control mechanism.

### Authentication and Authorization Guidelines
- Only the contract owner should have permission to add beneficiaries.

## Limitations and Future Enhancements

### Known Limitations of the Code
- The contract does not currently support complex inheritance structures.
- There is no mechanism for dispute resolution.

### Possible Areas of Improvement
- Implementing a dispute resolution mechanism.
- Adding support for multiple release conditions.

### Roadmap for Future Updates and Enchancements
- Intoduce multi-signature approval for withdrawals.
- Enable dynamic updates to beneficiary conditions.
